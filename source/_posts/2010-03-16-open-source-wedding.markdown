I'm getting Married this October and so I've created a wedding site for my personal use ([http://www.fairbarneswedding.com](http://www.fairbarneswedding.com)). I thought, why should I use it once and leave it to rot in source control somewhere? So I'm releasing it under the GNU GPL.

At the time of this writing the project has news articles, events calendar with rsvp, paypal integrated donation meter, wedding party members, wedding stories, and static pages. If you fork the project and make it better, send me a push request. You can find the source at [http://github.com/randomutterings/wedding](http://github.com/randomutterings/wedding)
